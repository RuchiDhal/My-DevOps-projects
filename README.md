## Overview
 In this project We are  leveraging the power of Amazon CloudWatch Events to proactively monitor EBS volumes. When a new EBS volume of type GP2 is created, a Lambda function is triggered automatically. This Lambda function efficiently converts the GP2 volume to the more cost-effective GP3 type, optimizing the performance and cost-efficiency of your AWS infrastructure. With AWS Ninja, you can effortlessly manage and optimize your EBS volumes, ensuring they align with your desired resource configuration and cost-saving goals."
  
#  Some Other application scenarios
- Enhance S3 Bucket Security: Employ Lambda functions to monitor S3 bucket access and enforce robust security measures, including prevention of public access, encryption of data at rest, and comprehensive access activity logging.

- Optimize EC2 Instances: Leverage Lambda functions to monitor key metrics like CPU utilization, allowing automatic adjustment of instance size or capacity based on workload. This ensures optimal performance and cost reduction.

- Automate Backups and Disaster Recovery: Utilize Lambda functions to schedule backups and automate essential disaster recovery processes, such as copying data to backup S3 buckets or launching new EC2 instances in case of failures.

- Streamline Routine Tasks: Automate repetitive tasks like database backups, log analysis, and file processing using Lambda functions. This reduces manual effort and improves overall operational efficiency.

- Enforce IAM Permissions and Roles: Utilize Lambda functions to enforce secure IAM policies and roles, including granting least privilege  access and rotating access keys. This strengthens security measures and enhances compliance.
